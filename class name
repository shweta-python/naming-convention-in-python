 Readability
Well-chosen identifiers make it significantly easier for developers and analysts to understand what the system is doing and how to fix or extend the source code to apply for new needs.
For example, although
 a = b * c;
is syntactically correct, its purpose is not evident. Contrast this with:
 weekly_pay = hours_worked * hourly_pay_rate;
